# It's finally happening isn't it?

I saw this pop up online a few days ago[^1]. a proposal for a new law to basically ban porn in Algeria. I guess we all knew it was coming sooner or later, after they blocked a few sites before, it felt like someone was testing the waters. Now, they're going for the whole ocean. 

Reading the comments, a lot of people seem really happy about it. Given our cultural and religious backdrop and, let's be honest, the general state of digital literacy and education, the online reaction was a predictable wave of "_Allahu Akbar_" and "_Finally!_". I mean, we saw it coming.

But hold on. Before we all jump on the bandwagon, let's take a closer look. This isn't just about banning naughty videos. It's about how we police the internet.

## Why this could have been _AWESOME_

On paper, the goal sounds almost saintly: **Protect the youth! Uphold societal values!** And look, I get it. The concerns are real. Porn sites are *alarmingly* high on the list of most visited websites here. In a culture where "the talk" is often no talk at all, the internet becomes the default, and deeply flawed, sex educator.

There's a genuine problem. At its core, this should be a fight to protect our society's most vulnerable: our children and our women. Early exposure messes with kids' heads. It fuels unhealthy attitudes and, let's not skirt around it, with _zina_ (fornication) prohibited in Islam and the social and financial pressures making marriage increasingly difficult, the sexual frustration contributes to the harassment women face daily.

**But...** (You knew there was a '_but_' coming, right?)

A problem this messy and human can't be solved with a simple technical kill switch. It's like using a flamethrower to deal with a spider in your house. Sure, the spider's gone, but so is your house. The house here being our freedom, privacy, and our right to access information.


## Let's Break Down This Law (Article by Article)

They've published the proposal[^Source]. Here’s the TL;DR, with a dash of commentary:

| Article | What It Says | What It *Could* Mean |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Goals: Block porn sites to align with values. | Sounds simple enough. |
| **2** | Defines illegal content as explicit material **or** "*material offensive to public decency.*" | "_Public decency_" is vaguer than a politician's promise. Who decides? |
| **3 & 11** | An unspecified "competent authority" gets to call the shots. | Unlimited power with zero checks, balances, or way to appeal? What could go wrong? |
| **5** | ISPs must block sites instantly and keep systems "effective." | This is the technical hammer. |
| **7** | Using/creating tools to bypass blocks gets you **1 year in prison.** | They're coming for your VPN. Yes, *that* VPN. |
| **9 & 10** | Fines (and worse) for companies that don't comply. | Expect Alrighty, let's dive into the messy bits.


# Do You See What I See?
## Who Gets to Decide?

The law points to a "competent authority" in **Article 3 & 11**. Sounds official, right? But it doesn't actually name who that is.

And here's the thing that gets me: there's no talk of a judge being involved. No mention of how you, or a company, can appeal if they block something by mistake. What if they accidentally (*or not so accidentally*) block an educational site, or a news blog? How do you even begin to challenge that?

It just puts all that power in one place, with no real rules or transparency. That's *never* a good idea. It's basically asking for someone to overstep, or to make a big error that none of us can fix.

## The Slippery Slope 

That phrase in **Article 2** "*material offensive to public decency*" is a legal nightmare. It's a blank check for censorship. Could it be used against:

*   **A health website** explaining STDs or safe sex, or anything related to sexual education?
*   **Classic art or literature** that includes nude figures?
*   **Political commentary** discussing women's rights or social reforms?

Without a crystal clear definition, this law isn't just about porn. It's about granting someone the power to decide what ideas are "_decent_" enough for you to see.

## The VPN Trap

**Article 7** is the real kicker for the tech savvy (or anyone who cares about online security). By criminalizing tools that bypass blocking a.k.a. **VPNs** they're not just going after porn seekers.

They're outlawing a standard tool for:
*   **Securing your data** on public Wi-Fi.
*   **Safe communication** for journalists or activists.
*   **Accessing global business platforms** and services.

It's a move that would digitally isolate the country, harm the economy, and make everyone *less* safe online, all while failing to stop a determined teenager with a credit card and a Google search.

## The Technical Quagmire and Collateral Damage

To comply with **Article 5**, ISPs will likely use blunt tools. If a platform like [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Reddit](https://reddit.com/), [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) hosts a single piece of "_indecent_" content, the easiest fix is to **block the entire site**. Poof. There goes your study group, your memes, your cloud storage.

# Precision over Prohibition

The intention to protect isn't wrong. But the method is as subtle as a brick. Instead of a national firewall that crushes everything in its path, why not try a smarter approach?

*   **Target the Source:** Push for mandatory, robust age verification *on* the porn sites themselves (like european countries are trying to pilot). Make *them* responsible.
*   **Empower Families, Not Just the State:** Launch a massive campaign to teach parents about **built-in parental controls** on routers, devices, and browsers (Google SafeSearch, YouTube Restricted Mode). A tech literate parent is worth a thousand firewalls.
*   **Define the Real Evil Clearly:** Write laws that surgically target universally condemned horrors like **child abuse material** or **revenge porn**. There's no debate there. Focus enforcement energy on that.
