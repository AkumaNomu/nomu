# How did it start?
Well, for the past months, I've been working on a site for myself, experimenting with different things, but I always ended up scrapping the whole thing mid-project. I decided I'll just simplify what I'm gonna make, and stick to it 100%, no matter how it ends up. So here we are on the 24th of december[^1], 2025, writing the first blog post.


# The making
## Setup
I just fed perplexity my vision for the project, it generated a generic site so i can start working on it. I hate the design it has, very generic and lacks taste, but it saves me quite a bit of time to change it rather than doing it from the ground up.
## New day
Here's mainly what I did:
- Added the contact section
- Working on the markdown formatting and blog posts
Well. something went wrong, and ive been trying to fix it for the past 2 hours but at this point i think starting from all over again is way easier. The posts are showing up on the blog list but aren't loading individually, it seems to be an issue with either html or css, but I couldn't seem to figure it out. 
## Sonnet
Claude. It's just peak. I avoid using it not to waste the free usage but right before it ended it made the website, perfect vision, no problems at all. I wonder if perplexity pro really has Sonnet 4.5 or is it just a hoax
# Features
## Tech
#### Vanilla HTML, CSS and javascript. 
The genius behind it: do i really need more? 
It's also Front-end only. In reality, I can't use any other frameworks, and I didn't want to go through the extra hassle of dealing with anything more complex than necessary.
#### Formspree
Just something quick and easy for anonymous messages. Won't get bothered with spam too.
#### Markdownit
## Index
Pretty simple, just showcases the latest posts and has my socials alongside an anonymous message form
## Blog
Search, Filters, and simple article metadata
## Articles
