# Agency scam?
## HMMMM...
I got sent an agency by a friend of mine, when I contacted them on Instagram they immediately asked me for what majors I wanted and some relevant information about me. They immediately mentioned a need to pass a test called **CSCA** afterwards, ***keep this in mind***.
They also sent me a picture of all the majors available for scholarships.

Funny thing here is, it isn't really that long. The list they provided is **80 items long**, while if you remove the duplicates it's only **45 items long** ( Assuming *Electrical and Computer Engineering, Electronic Information Engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Electronic Science and Technology, Electrical engineering and automation* are all different majors. )

Let's skip that, maybe the English and Computer Science majors duplicated more than 5 times were mistakes.
## How much?
When they sent me their fees, I started seeing their **predatory tactics**:
- **Registration fees:** ***60.000DZD***
- **Scholarship fees:** ***600-1400EUR***, depending on what it provides ( Tuition, rent, stipend )
- **Visa fees:** ***15.000DZD***
- **Airport welcome:** ***20.000DZD***
#### Application fees
They never specified how many universities I will be applying to. **60.000DZD is only enough to apply to 3-4 universities**.
The problem here is that they say they can **guarantee acceptance** into the universities, the safest application tactic is to apply to hard reach universities, medium difficulty, and then have a couple of universities as fall back. Applying to a small number of universities while claiming that it is ***guaranteed*** means that they will force you to target ***small universities***.
#### Scholarship fees
First of all, they only said that they apply to **university specific scholarships**, not the state or city funded ones, which is ***utterly stupid*** as what's the point of wasting those opportunities?
Second of all, they claim that ***after being accepted*** you pay the "fees". And the fees depend on what type of scholarship you get accepted into.
This is probably where they make **most of their money**, as it is basically a ***fake added cost***, and is pretty substantial. It's made this way because the psychological worth of the scholarships is the most significant to people, so they try to ***milk money*** from them this way.
#### Visa fees
Pretty reasonable to be fair.
#### Airport welcome?
Although I didn't want to seem attacking the last one was baffling, so I questioned them about it.
> "We will meet you, the students, at Beijing or Shanghai airport and complete the necessary procedures.
> And if the number of students in the same university exceeds 10 in one batch, we will arrange for them to go together to the university.
> We Explain to them how to get to the university, where they'll be studying, and make sure they understand what to do immediately upon arrival.
> When you arrive you don't know the language at the airport and don't know how to get out of there, since Chinese people don't speak English."

1. **No such things as necessary procedures.**
2. **No free ride?**
3. The information they explain can be simply done through text or call. ***No need for extra payment.***
4. Although people don't understand English, from my own experience navigating China with a speech-to-text app is ***perfectly fine***.

However, they said it is optional, so I told them I would not like to pay the extra fee for it ( although I'm not planning on using any of their services for that matter ).

## FOMO, obviously
When I asked them when the deadlines are:
> "It's registration based on seats.  
> We have a ***limited number of seats*** — once the application quota is filled, registration closes.
> Full scholarships are most likely to end by the end of March.  
> Since some countries have high GPAs, like Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, they quickly take up these seats.  
> That’s why the earlier someone submits their file, the better.  
> **Admission is guaranteed.**  
> So they should apply quickly as long as all requirements are met, of course.

***That's not how universities work.*** Most universities wait until the application deadline arrives to start checking them. Also why would they have a limited number of students they register? It's just creating a **sense of urgency**.




# Enter CSCA
Well, remember when they mentioned **CSCA**? Yeah, turns out it's ***pretty important***.
It's **8th of February 2026** as I'm writing this. The next CSCA exam is on **March 15th**, and I need to pass both ***mathematics and physics***. It's pretty cheap, **700RMB**.
However resources and information are **pretty scarce**, I found a discord community that has some free stuff but most things found online are ***paid courses*** or ***paid mock exams***, and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't pay for those things.

# Well, documents?
According to the agency, I need the following:
- **High School Diploma + Grades (Baccalaureate)** ***original*** + official ***translation***
- **Certificate of No Criminal Record (Police Clearance)** ***original*** + official ***translation***
- **Medical Examination Report** ( They sent it to me on Whatsapp)
- **Application form**
- **English Language Proficiency Certificate**
- **Bank Statement** (showing a minimum of ***500.000DZD or 3,000EUR***)
- **Study Plan**
- **Curriculum Vitae (CV)**
- **Digital (Electronic) Passport-sized Photo**
- **Passport**
 But I'm not sure exactly yet, I will need to wait until applying to see, but I'll make sure to apply **as early as possible**.

# ***So what?***
I'm not sure I even want to study in China, which city, which universities, whether or not to do a language year, but I'll make sure to update as I make more research.
