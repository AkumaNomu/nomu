# Katex
I'm writing a new post about "[_mai_](blog.html?post=MAIV1)" (I'll be posting it shortly after this one)

I basically mentioned the time complexity of a certain function and realised I can't use any math formatting on the blog...

***Sigh... I'm really gonna sidetrack and try to add Latex aren't I?*** 

Turns out it's pretty straightforward, just needed to update the initMarkdown function in markdown-parser.js and add a couple of scripts to the HTML. Well it wasn't Latex, it's Katex (boo I spoiled it in the title), but I don't cringe when I see mathematical formulas or symbols written in regular text so a win is a win!
