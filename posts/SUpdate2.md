# Music
## Implementation
I wanted to add music to the site, to let whoever is reading feel my vibe as one might say, which wasn't that hard at first, just adding a simple button to pause and unpause and control the volume. 

Also, music cannot autoplay unless you interact with the site hence the popup at the beginning.

## Music Choice
I went with [World's Number One Oden Store](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=h3YnC9qEgcQ&list=PLzI1QBg5Pq7LRvdBwFm5nl3l7giy8p6FI).

I'm actually thinking about making it a playlist but I don't want to make loading the site take too long since the browser just plays an mp3 file instead of streaming it, I'm thinking of changing the system to keep it constantly updated depending on my mood somehow, but that's for the far future, for now, enjoy the one piece OST.

# Merging...
Well, the biggest problem was that upon clicking on any post, or changing anything in the page, the music would stop and reset, so I changed the way the blog posts load and decided merging the index page with the blogs page is fine since they both are relatively empty. 

I have other ideas for other pages in the future, but I think the blog posts being on the front page is gonna stick around for a while

# Pagination

Since the contact form and links are at the bottom, I needed to make the posts appear in groups of 5 only.  

# Table of Contents

Thought it would be nice to add a table of contents to enhance the reading experience and fill up the empty space. So I added a button to toggle it and clicking on any header title scrolls you there

# Smooth Scrolling

Speaking of scrolling, I just made the autoscrolling smoother!
