# Looks

## Style
Even though I really liked the previous version’s look, I felt it was time for something fresher and bolder. Everything’s more rounded now, kind of soft, but still sharp where it counts.

## Buttons
Moved the table of contents button into the navbar to keep things tidy and within reach.

# Functionalities

## Settings
Added a settings button to the navbar! Inside, you can switch between color themes and control the music all from one neat little panel.

## Music
The music player’s been upgraded. Now you can pause, play, adjust the volume, and even pick from five preset tracks. Still thinking about adding more songs dynamically… but for now, vibe with the selection.

## Scrolling
Added a scrolling progress bar at the top of the page, plus a “scroll to top” button for when you’re deep into a post and want to bounce back up.

# Hero Section
Took out the random text and replaced it with a featured post up top, plus a featured quote card. keeps the landing page feeling alive.

# Blog

## Search
The search bar now suggests results as you type and keeps a history of what you’ve looked for. Oh, and there’s a clear button. Because sometimes you just wanna start over.

## Postcards
Gave the post cards a whole new look. Might tweak them again soon, but for now… I’m feeling it.

## Posts
Headers inside posts are now clickable, making it easier to jump around. Also started working on a “share” feature. Not fully done yet, but it’s coming.

# Loading
Added a smooth loading screen that pops up when you first visit, and also when you click into or out of a blog post.
